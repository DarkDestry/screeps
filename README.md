# DarkDestry's Screeps AI
A self-sustainable AI for screeps (Hopefully). 

## Getting Started

To get started, 
1. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Copy the sample `.screeps.json.sample` to `.screeps.json` and fill in the appropriate data. `private_directory` is for private servers only and is the steam directory where the scripts are stored locally.
3. Run the grunt file using `grunt` for committing to the public server and `grunt private` for committing to your steam directory.

User intervention is required to place down the first spawn in an appropriately open space. This will be automated in the future.
